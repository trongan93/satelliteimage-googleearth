# Satellite images downloading
### Author: Trong-An Bui (http://buitrongan.com/)
The old version is build from August 30, 2019, the last commit is July 26, 2020 and availble at https://github.com/trongan93/AILandimage
From the same motivation with old version. This project is used Google Earth Engine API to build a landslide image from GLC records. A Landsat, Sentinel, and ALOS satellite image programs are used to create images data. This project is improved the performance, query condition and downloading speed


This is a part of the project "Landslide prediction from Satellite images". Project details at my personal website and my publications (listened below).

Please refer my records.
