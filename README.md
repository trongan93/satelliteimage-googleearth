To build a landslide image from GLC records by Google Earth Engine API. A Landsat, Sentinel, and ALOS satellite image programs are used to create images data.
The old version is build on February 10, 2020 and availble at https://github.com/trongan93/AILandimage

This is a part of the project "Landslide prediction from Satellite images". More detailed details at my personal website and my publications (listened below).
